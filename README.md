# This project implements a classic Tic Tac Toe game in C++, enhanced with an unbeatable AI powered by the MiniMax algorithm.

## Features

- Classic Tic Tac Toe: Play the traditional 3x3 Tic Tac Toe game  
- Unbeatable AI: Experience a challenging game against an AI that uses the MiniMax algorithm to ensure optimal moves every time.
- Console-Based Interface: Simple text-based interface for easy gameplay.

## MiniMax Algorithm
The AI is implemented using the MiniMax algorithm, which ensures that the AI always makes the best possible move, making it unbeatable. The algorithm evaluates all possible moves and their outcomes, selecting the move that maximizes the AI's chances of winning while minimizing the player's chances.

## Future Plans
- Graphical User Interface (GUI): Integrate with SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library) to create an interactive GUI.
- Mouse and Keyboard Input: Enhance the gameplay experience by allowing input from the mouse and keyboard.
